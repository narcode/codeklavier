# Mottipets

This piece allows the piano player to live code in SuperCollider. It was
presented at [SHA2017](https://sha2017.org) by @wooloogooloo and @narcode. You
can watch their presentation, concert, and performance on
[youtube](https://youtu.be/efU7trVAPvA).

If you play a tremmelo on the piano, the code will recognize this series and
uses the distance between the notes as a number input.

## SuperCollider
Perhaps @narcode can say something and explain about the supercollider.

## Run
Make sure you installed supercollider and the required libraries before you
start motipets. Then you can start by ``python3 motippets.py``.
