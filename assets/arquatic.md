# ARquatic  - A CodeKlavier Augmented Reality Experience

## Concept

Codeklavierâ€™s â€˜ARquaticâ€™ is an audio and Augmented Reality experience where the live music provides the DNA of the underwater creatures unfolding before your eyes. Full of speculative, fantasy structures artificially built from [L-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) rules, â€˜ARquaticâ€™ superimposes unusual aquatic inspired objects in everyday environments. Whether you attend a live performance or tune in at home for a streamed experience, the juxtaposition from the surroundings with the AR objects will stimulate oneâ€™s imagination by highlighting the contrasting beauty of the natural and the unnatural world.

## Download
The ARquatic app is available for download [here for Apple](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/arquatic/id1557620712?l=en) and [here for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=space.codeklavier.arquatic&hl=en_US&gl=US). You will need an Apple iPhone SE/6S model (or later) or one of the Android phones listed [here](https://developers.google.com/ar/devices). You can also simply follow the link for the app download and try out the demo channel. It is useful to do this in advance in case your phone does not support AR but your tablet does - in which case, we advise you to bring your tablet! If you do not own an AR supported device, a non-AR version will still show visuals on your Android phone.


## About the technology
The â€˜ARquaticâ€™ experience is made possible by three key technological elements and stages; CodeKlavier, Lindemayer and the ARquatic App.

CodeKlavier: a system that enables the pianist to code by playing the piano. In â€˜ARquaticâ€™, this pianist is using the [CKalcuÎ»ator](https://github.com/narcode/codeklavier/tree/master/ckalculator) module to create numbers using lambda calculus. These numbers are then translated into symbols used in the Lindenmayer systems engine. 

The L-systems engine is the second element and transforms the symbols into formal grammars defining the starting point and L-system rules. Together these form the L-system trees creating the structures of the AR visual elements which you see.

These structures, along with some characteristics of the piano playing, are then applied to the visuals designed by Patrick Borgeat and rendered in Unity. This is the final step of the technological process and produces the AR visuals which you experience during the show on the ARquatic app.

## Motivation
Our inspiration for working with L-systems comes primarily from its roots in nature and organic growth which we would like to bring to the musical and programming paradigms. Whilst L-systems are already widely used in generative art and music, we are interested in exploring how this simple model can be used by the piano coder to express complex structures and how its rules will shape the pianistic improvisation. Furthermore, Lindenmayerâ€™s work was done here at the University of Utrecht in 1968 and building upon it through artistic exploration, makes the Netherlands a particularly special home for the development and presentation of this project.
