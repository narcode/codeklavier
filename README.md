# CodeKlavier
### Live coding with the piano as interface.

An open source project by Felipe Ignacio Noriega and Anne Veinberg. Supported By **Stimuleringsfonds Creatieve Industrie** for its developement and
**FondsPodiumKunsten NL** for public presentations

CodeKlavier development started in April 2017 and currently has two prototypes (newest on top):
+  *Motippets* (coding via pianistic gestures/motifs)
+ *hello world* (proof of concept prototype, with 1-1 mapping of piano keys to alphanumeric characters)

More information about the specific prototypes can be found in their respective directories.


A performance on these prototypes was presented at SHA2017 and can be viewed here:<br>

## Equipment
1. An acoustic-MIDI piano such as a Yamaha Disklavier, any piano fitted with a silent system or an acoustic intrument in combination with a MOOG piano bar. If an acoustic-MIDI piano is not available, any 88-key MIDI keyboard will suffice providing this instrument is of suitable sensitivity for the pianist.

2. MIDI interface (in case this is not present in the piano)

## Libraries
Install with pip3

1. python-rtmidi
2. pynput
3. sphinx

Run ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt`` to install the required libraries.

## SuperCollider

Please install the latest release of [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io)

__For this developement branch add the CodeKlavier directory to your sys.path so the CK modules are recognized__

in your ~/.bash_profile or equivalent add the following lines (make sure you have the correct path!):

`# Modules for the CodeKlavier
PYTHONPATH="/path/to/your/codeklavier/project/folder:$PYTHONPATH"
export PYTHONPATH`

As an example, the path to the Codeklavier in my system looks like this:
`
PYTHONPATH="/Users/narcodeb/Development/Repos/codeklavier-python/CodeKlavier:$PYTHONPATH"
`

## Test run
After installing the libraries, plug in your midi device and run the miditest by ``python3 miditest.py``. After you complete the setup and configuration, you will see the midi messages on the screen. After that: try playing a ``hello world`` piece. Move into the ``hello world`` directory and run ``python3 hello_world.py``.
